                <h3>This project enabled me to gain insight into what makes an art movement. People 
                    look at a painting by Monet and know itâ€™s from the impressionism movement because that 
                    is what we are taught; but when they see a painting and sense that itâ€™s impressionistic, 
                    they show an understanding of the differences of style and technique derived from different movements. 
                    My goal in this project was to push the strongest concepts found in different art movements and portraying 
                    them in logos. Creating flowing logos that loop through videos amplified some of the prevailing concepts of
                     my logos, such as color, shape, and brushstrokes.
